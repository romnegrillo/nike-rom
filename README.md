# Nike Rom

This project leverages Tailwind to craft a clean and consistent UI/UX centered around Nike products. The design approach is both simple and effective, highlighting the ease with which Tailwind aids web development. Every page on the site resonates with a cohesive orange Nike theme. I was planning to add more features to it by creating a backend and turning it into simple eCommerce but since this is just my first UI/UX-focused project, I'll just create another app for that next time. Definitely gonna study web animations next time.
